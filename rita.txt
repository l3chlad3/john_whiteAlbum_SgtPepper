Lovely Rita
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid, nothing can come between us
when it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
when I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book

In the cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid, may I inquire discreetly
When you are free to take some tea with me

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.
